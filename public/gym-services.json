    "description": "A boxer's training depends largely on the point in their career at which he or she is situated. If the boxer is just a beginner, a minimal training routine might consist of learning how to hit a heavy bag, a speed bag, or a double end bag as well as doing shadowboxing in front of a mirror, skipping rope, calisthenics and jogging every day, as well as an occasional practice bout inside the ring (sparring). Most beginning boxers will spend most of their early careers conditioning and establishing the fundamentals. For the amateur or professional boxer preparing for a competition or bout, however, training is much more stringent. Boxing is widely considered one of the most physically demanding sports in the world.",

In the last few years, the frequency of judo competitions has increased significantly. Athletes thus face the challenge of maintaining a steady, high level of physical performance and decision-making skills for an extended period",

    "description": "Yoga is an old discipline from India, which has changed a lot over time. Practitioners and followers of the original yoga traditions focused on “expanding spiritual energy using breathing methods and mental focus”. If you are performing full-body compound lifts at the gym and lifting weights explosively, for example some kettlebell exercises, you will activate your fast twitch muscle fibres. This helps you develop power and speed. In yoga, performing slow movements and holding position for a while, you will be working slow-twitch muscle fibres, which build endurance. It is important to maintain balance between both types of muscle fibres! As discussed above, there is no doubt that yoga is amazing for both your mental and physical health. However, if you want to give your bones and muscles the best fighting chance against loss and damage it is important to cross train.",
